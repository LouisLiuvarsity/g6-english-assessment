    passage: `Restaurants & Takeaways

A Marina

There's no better fish restaurant in town than Marina, where you can have your meal in front of the restaurant, next to the sea. At night, a band performs for the restaurant's customers. A bit expensive, but the great food and the wonderful atmosphere are really worth it. Open lunchtimes and evenings, Monday-Saturday.

B Salt and pepper

Salt and pepper is a new and different type of restaurant. If you like your dish, you can ask for the recipe and attend a cookery course to learn how to make it. The menu includes fish, meat and vegetarian dishes. It's located in an area convenient for public transport. Open Mondays to Fridays, until 5 p.m.

C Michael's

This lovely French restaurant is in a lovely countryside spot, but anybody can get here on foot. There's also a train station very close by. Michael's has always been a favourite with groups, who can ask for the discounted menu, which includes meat and fish options. Open lunchtimes and evenings.

D Reds and Company

Reds and Company is in a peaceful location near green fields, so it's perfect after a walk or a bicycle ride. There's a large back garden with tables and lots of space for the bikes. They serve Italian, Spanish and French dishes at a low cost. Open from Friday to Saturday.

E Clowns

Run by a nice French family, this is the best place for a cheap break on a long bike ride. Located in a country park five miles from the city centre, Clowns offers sandwiches or snacks to take away. There is a small garden with a few tables at the back. Open lunchtimes only.

F The Cinnamon

This vegetarian restaurant is very popular with young people who want entertainment while they eat. Every Monday night, there are live music sessions in the main hall. At lunchtime, The Cinnamon offers a special deal to families and large groups. It can be reached by bus. Open every day.

G O'Neill's

This British restaurant uses traditional ingredients in new, original recipes. There are many vegetarian and fish dishes. There's a large room upstairs which can be booked by groups. O'Neill's is in the city centre and very close to several bus stops. Open every evening and lunchtimes only on Saturdays and Sundays. Quite expensive.

H The Blue Boat

This restaurant specialises in fish and seafood, but also offers a large vegetarian choice. It's quite popular with families as there's play equipment in the garden. The Blue Boat is located in a quiet area outside the city, so you need a car to get there. Open from midday to midnight every day.`,
